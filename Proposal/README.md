# Proposal
## NutriTrack- Personalized Calorie and Nutrition Management

In a world where health and fitness are increasingly at the forefront of peopleâ€™s minds, there is a growing need for tools that can help individuals manage their dietary habits effectively. NutriTrack is a proposed Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to address this need by providing a user-friendly platform for tracking nutritional intake and managing diet goals.

NutriTrack is designed to simplify the complex and often tedious process of calorie and macro-nutrient tracking. Our target users range from those embarking on a fitness journey, individuals with specific dietary needs, to health enthusiasts who value a detailed understanding of their food intake. These users are in need of an accessible, easy-to-use tool that supports their nutritional goals.

NutriTrack will empower users to:
- Input and store recipes along with their macro-nutrient profiles.
* Track their daily caloric and macro-nutrient intake against personalized goals.
+ Visualize their progress through a dynamic, data-rich dashboard.
- Receive tailored insights to guide them towards their nutritional targets.

The application will source data from a rich database of food items and recipes, enhanced by user contributions. Users will engage with the platform by entering their meals, recipes, and tracking their daily intake.

Leveraging PWA capabilities, NutriTrack will provide:
- Offline access to the application, enabling users to log meals and view data without an internet connection.
* Real-time synchronization for a consistent experience across various devices.
+ Push notifications to prompt users to stay on track with their goals.
- A lightweight, no-installation-required app experience, with the responsiveness and feel of a native application.

Our wireframes showcase both mobile and desktop views, emphasizing our mobile-first approach while ensuring a responsive and adaptable design for desktop use. The wireframes depict key functionalities such as recipe addition, dashboard analytics, and account management.
- "Add Recipe" view: A straightforward interface for entering recipe details and macro-nutrient values.
* "Dashboard" view: An interactive display of graphs and progress meters, offering users a snapshot of their nutritional status.
+ "Login/Create Account" view: A secure and simple entry point to personal dashboards, allowing for account creation and login.

These wireframes guide the development of NutriTrack, focusing on a user-centric design philosophy.
